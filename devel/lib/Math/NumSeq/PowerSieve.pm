=head1 NAME

Math::NumSeq::PowerSieve -- sieved out powers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::NumSeq::PowerSieve;
 my $seq = Math::NumSeq::PowerSieve->new;
 my ($i, $value) = $seq->next;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is repeated sieving out of powers of a base integer.  The default is 2

    1, 3, 5, 9, 11, 13, 17, 21, 25, 27, 29, 33, 35, 37, 43, 49, ...

The sieve starts with all integers

    1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13

Then sieve out all the multiple of 2 positions (which leaves the odd
numbers)

    1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25,...

Then sieve out all the multiple of 4 positions, for example 7 at position 4
is the first removed

    1,3,5,9,11,13,17,19,21,25,...

Then multiple of 8 positions (value 19 here), then 16, 32, etc.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See L<Math::NumSeq/FUNCTIONS> for behaviour common to all sequence classes.

=over 4

=item C<$seq = Math::NumSeq::PowerSieve-E<gt>new ()>

Create and return a new sequence object.
