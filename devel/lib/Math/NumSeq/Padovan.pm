=head1 NAME

Math::NumSeq::Padovan -- Padovan sequence

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::NumSeq::Padovan;
 my $seq = Math::NumSeq::Padovan->new;
 my ($i, $value) = $seq->next;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<In progress ...>

This is the Padovan sequence,

    1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 16, 21, 28, 37, 49, 65, ...

which is the recurrence

    P[i] = P[i-2] + P[i-3]

starting from 1,1,1.  So for example 28 is 12+16.

    12, 16, 21, 28

     |   |       ^
     |   |       |
     +---+---add-+

The recurrence is the same as the Perrin sequence (L<Math::NumSeq::Perrin>)
but with different staring values.

=head2 Triangles

There's an attractive geometric interpretation of these numbers.

                           \ /             \ /
                            +---------------+

The pattern starts from an equilateral triangle of side length 1, the lower
left one shown above.  Then put a new triangle successively to the right,
left and lower sides, each time the side length of the triangle is the width
of the figure so far.

The effect is to add the immediately preceding triangle side and the side of
the 5th previous,

    P[i] = P[i-1] + P[i-5]

This is the same as the i-2,i-3 formula shown above since

    P[i] = P[i-2] + P[i-3]          # formula above
         = P[i-4]+P[i-5] + P[i-3]
         = P[i-3]+P[i-4] + P[i-5]
         = P[i-1] + P[i-5]          # geometric form
