=head1 NAME

Math::NumSeq::FibbinaryBitCount -- number of bits in each fibbinary number

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::NumSeq::FibbinaryBitCount;
 my $seq = Math::NumSeq::FibbinaryBitCount->new;
 my ($i, $value) = $seq->next;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The number of 1 bits in the i'th fibbinary number.

    0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, ...
    starting i=0

For example i=9 is Fibbinary "1001" so value=2 for 2 1-bits.

The count is 1 for the Fibonacci numbers, as they're "100..00" with a single
1-bit in fibbinary.

=head2 Digit 0

Option C<digit =E<gt> "0"> counts instead the 0-bits

    # digit=>"0"   starting i=0
    0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 5, 4, 4, 4, 3, 4, ...

i=0 is considered to be an empty set of digits, so it has value=0.  This is
the same as the C<DigitCount> sequence treats i=0.

=head2 Digit 00

Option C<digit =E<gt> "00"> counts the 0-bits which don't follow a 1-bit,
which is equivalent to "00" pairs (including overlapping pairs).

    # digit=>"00"   starting i=0
    0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 3, 2, 1, 1, 0, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, ...

For example i=42 is fibbinary "10010000" (42=34+8).  It has value=4 for 4
0-bits not counting the two which immediately follow the two 1-bits.  Or
equivalently 4 "00" pairs

             v  vvv    four 0s which don't follow a 1
    i=42   10010000
            ^^ ^^      four "00" pairs, overlaps allowed
                ^^
                 ^^

Fibbinary numbers by definition never have consecutive 1-bits, so there's
always a 0 following a 1.  Excluding those leaves a count of genuinely
skipped positions.

When passing the "00" option don't forget to quote it as a string, since a
literal number 00 is an octal 0.

    $seq = Math::NumSeq::FibbinaryBitCount->new (digit => "00");  # good
    $seq = Math::NumSeq::FibbinaryBitCount->new (digit => 00);    # bad

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See L<Math::NumSeq/FUNCTIONS> for behaviour common to all sequence classes.

=over 4

=item C<$seq = Math::NumSeq::FibbinaryBitCount-E<gt>new ()>

=item C<$seq = Math::NumSeq::FibbinaryBitCount-E<gt>new (digit =E<gt> $str)>

Create and return a new sequence object.

=back

=head2 Random Access

=over

=item C<$value = $seq-E<gt>ith($i)>

Return the bit count of the C<$i>'th fibbinary number.

=item C<$bool = $seq-E<gt>pred($value)>

Return true if C<$value> occurs as a bit count, which simply means C<$value
E<gt>= 0>.
