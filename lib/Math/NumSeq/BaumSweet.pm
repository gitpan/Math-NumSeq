=head1 NAME

Math::NumSeq::BaumSweet -- Baum-Sweet sequence

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::NumSeq::BaumSweet;
 my $seq = Math::NumSeq::BaumSweet->new;
 my ($i, $value) = $seq->next;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Baum-Sweet sequence

    starting i=0
    1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, ...

where each value is 1 if the index i contains no odd-length run of 0 bits,
or 0 if it does.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See L<Math::NumSeq/FUNCTIONS> for behaviour common to all sequence classes.

=over 4

=item C<$seq = Math::NumSeq::BaumSweet-E<gt>new ()>

Create and return a new sequence object.

=back

=head2 Random Access

=over

=item C<$value = $seq-E<gt>ith($i)>

Return the C<$i>'th BaumSweet number, ie. 1 or 0 according to whether C<$i>
is without or with an odd-length run of 0 bits.

=item C<$bool = $seq-E<gt>pred($value)>

Return true if C<$value> occurs in the sequence, which simply means 0 or 1.
