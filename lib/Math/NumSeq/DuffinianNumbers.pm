=head1 NAME

Math::NumSeq::DuffinianNumbers -- no common factor with sum of divisors

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::NumSeq::DuffinianNumbers;
 my $seq = Math::NumSeq::DuffinianNumbers->new ();
 my ($i, $value) = $seq->next;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the Duffinian numbers which are composites having no common factor
with their sum of divisors.

    starting i=1
    4, 8, 9, 16, 21, 25, 27, 32, 35, 36, 39, 49, 50, 55, 57, 63, ...

For example 21 has divisors 1,3,7,21 total 32 which has no common factor
with 21.  Only composites are included since primes would not be
particularly interesting for this rule.  They'd having only divisors 1,p and
so p+1 never having a common factor with p.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See L<Math::NumSeq/FUNCTIONS> for behaviour common to all sequence classes.

=over 4

=item C<$seq = Math::NumSeq::DuffinianNumbers-E<gt>new ()>

Create and return a new sequence object.

=item C<$bool = $seq-E<gt>pred($value)>

Return true if C<$value> is a Duffinian number.

In the current code a hard limit of 2**32 is placed on the C<$value> to be
checked, in the interests of not going into a near-infinite loop.  The
return is C<undef> for bigger values.
