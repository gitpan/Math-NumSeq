=head1 NAME

Math::NumSeq::HappyNumbers -- reaching 1 under repeated sum of squares of digits

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::NumSeq::HappyNumbers;
 my $seq = Math::NumSeq::HappyNumbers->new;
 my ($i, $value) = $seq->next;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This sequence is the happy numbers 1,7,10,13,19,23,etc, which are the
numbers eventually reaching 1 on repeatedly taking the sum of the squares of
the digits.

For example 23 is a happy number because the sum of squares of its digits
(ie. 2 and 3) is 2*2+3*3=13, then the same sum of squares again 1*1+3*3=10,
then 1*1+0*0=1 reaches 1.

In decimal it can be shown that for a non-zero starting point this procedure
always reaches either 1 or the cycle 4,16,37,58,89,145,42,20.  The values
which reach 1 are called happy numbers.

An optional C<radix> parameter can select a base other than decimal.  Base 2
and base 4 are not very interesting since for them every number except 0 is
happy.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See L<Math::NumSeq/FUNCTIONS> for behaviour common to all sequence classes.

=over 4

=item C<$seq = Math::NumSeq::HappyNumbers-E<gt>new ()>

=item C<$seq = Math::NumSeq::HappyNumbers-E<gt>new (radix =E<gt> $r)>

Create and return a new sequence object.

=item C<$bool = $seq-E<gt>pred($value)>

Return true if C<$value> is a happy number, meaning repeated sum of squares
of its digits reaches 1.
