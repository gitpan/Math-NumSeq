=head1 NAME

Math::NumSeq::DedekindPsiSteps -- psi function until 2^x*3^y

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::NumSeq::DedekindPsiSteps;
 my $seq = Math::NumSeq::DedekindPsiSteps->new;
 my ($i, $value) = $seq->next;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This sequence is the how many repeated applications of the Dedekind psi
function are required to reach a number of the form 2^x*3^y.

    0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,2,1,1,0,1,0,2,1,1,1,1,0,2,2,0,1,2,...

The psi function is

    psi(n) =        product          (p+1) * p^(e-1)
             prime factors p^e in n

The p+1 means that one copy of each distinct prime in n is changed from p to
p+1.  That p+1 is even, so although the value has increased the prime
factors are all less than p.  Repeated applying that reduction eventually
reaches just primes 2 and 3 in some quantity.

For example i=25 requires 2 steps,

    psi(25) = (5+1)*5 = 30 = 2*3*5
    then
    psi(30) = (2+1)*(3+1)*(5+1) = 72 = 2*2*2*3*3

If i is already 2s and 3s then it's considered no steps are required and the
value is 0.  For example at i=12=2*2*3 the value is 0.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See L<Math::NumSeq/FUNCTIONS> for behaviour common to all sequence classes.

=over 4

=item C<$seq = Math::NumSeq::DedekindPsiSteps-E<gt>new ()>

Create and return a new sequence object.

=back

=head2 Random Access

=over

=item C<$value = $seq-E<gt>ith($i)>

Return the number of repeated applications of the psi function on C<$i>
required to reach just factors 2 and 3.

This calculation requires factorizing C<$i> and in the current code after
small factors a hard limit of 2**32 is enforced in the interests of not
going into a near-infinite loop.  Above that the return is C<undef>.
