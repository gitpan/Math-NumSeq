=head1 NAME

Math::NumSeq::DedekindPsiCumulative -- cumulative Psi function

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::NumSeq::DedekindPsiCumulative;
 my $seq = Math::NumSeq::DedekindPsiCumulative->new;
 my ($i, $value) = $seq->next;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The cumulative Dedekind Psi function,

    1, 4, 8, 14, 20, 32, 40, 52, 64, 82, 94, 118, ...
    starting i=1

    value = sum n=1 to n=i of Psi(n)

where the Psi function is

    Psi(n) =        product          (p+1) * p^(e-1)
             prime factors p^e in n

The p+1 means one copy of each distinct prime in n is changed from p to p+1.
This is similar to Euler's totient function phi(n) (see
L<Math::NumSeq::Totient>) but phi(n) is p-1 instead of p+1.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See L<Math::NumSeq/FUNCTIONS> for behaviour common to all sequence classes.

=over 4

=item C<$seq = Math::NumSeq::DedekindPsiCumulative-E<gt>new ()>

Create and return a new sequence object.

=item C<$i = $seq-E<gt>value_to_i_estimate($value)>

Return an estimate of the i corresponding to C<$value>.  Currently this is
based on the asymptotic

    value = 15*n^2/(2*Pi^2) + O(n*log(n))

which neglecting the O(n*log(n)) becomes

    i ~= sqrt(value) * pi/sqrt(15/2)
