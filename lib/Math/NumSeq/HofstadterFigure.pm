=head1 NAME

Math::NumSeq::HofstadterFigure -- sequence excludes its own first differences

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::NumSeq::HofstadterFigure;
 my $seq = Math::NumSeq::HofstadterFigure->new;
 my ($i, $value) = $seq->next;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is Douglas Hofstadter's "figure" sequence which comprises all integers
except those which are differences between its own successive values,

    1, 3, 7, 12, 18, 26, 35, 45, 56, 69, 83, 98, ...

So for example at value=1 the next cannot be 2 because the difference 2-1=1
is already in the sequence, so value=3 with difference 3-1=2 is next.  Then
the next cannot be 4 since 4-3=1 is already in the sequences, and likewise
5-3=2 and 6-3=3, so the next is value=7 with 7-3=4 not already in the
sequence.

The effect is that the sequence increments by 1,2,3,4, etc but excluding
values of the sequence itself.  This makes it close to the Triangular
numbers i*(i+1)/2, but incrementing by a little extra at the places it skips
its own values.

=head2 Start Value

The optional C<start =E<gt> $value> can give the first value for the
sequence, instead of the default 1.  For example starting at 2

    2, 3, 7, 12, 18, 26, 35, 45, 56, ...

or starting at 5

    5, 6, 8, 11, 15, 22, 31, 41, 53, 66, ...

The differences are still the values not in the sequence, so for example
starting at 5 means the differences are 1, 2, 3, 4 before skipping 5 and 6.

In general the effect is to push the first skip up a bit, but still settles
down to grow roughly like the triangular numbers.

The start > must be 1 or more.  If the start was 0 then the first value and
first difference would always be the same, contradicting the conditions for
the sequence.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See L<Math::NumSeq/FUNCTIONS> for behaviour common to all sequence classes.

=over 4

=item C<$seq = Math::NumSeq::HofstadterFigure-E<gt>new ()>

=item C<$seq = Math::NumSeq::HofstadterFigure-E<gt>new (start =E<gt> $value)>
