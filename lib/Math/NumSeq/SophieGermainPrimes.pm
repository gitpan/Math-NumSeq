=head1 NAME

Math::NumSeq::SophieGermainPrimes -- Sophie Germain primes p and 2*p+1 prime

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::NumSeq::SophieGermainPrimes;
 my $seq = Math::NumSeq::SophieGermainPrimes->new;
 my ($i, $value) = $seq->next;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The primes P for which 2*P+1 is also prime,

    2, 3, 5, 11, 23, 29, 41, 53, 83, 89, 113, 131, 173, 179, ...
    starting i=1

=cut

# X<Germain, Sophie>Sophie Germain proved that for such primes Fermat's last
# theorem is true, ie. if p is an S-G prime then x^p+y^p=z^p has no solution
# in integers x,y,z not zero and not multiples of p ... maybe.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See L<Math::NumSeq/FUNCTIONS> for behaviour common to all sequence classes.

=over 4

=item C<$seq = Math::NumSeq::SophieGermainPrimes-E<gt>new ()>

Create and return a new sequence object.

=item C<$bool = $seq-E<gt>pred($value)>

Return true if C<$value> is a Sophie Germain prime, meaning both C<$value>
and C<2*$value+1> are prime.

=item C<$i = $seq-E<gt>value_to_i_estimate($value)>

Return an estimate of the i corresponding to C<$value>.

X<Hardy>X<Littlewood>Currently this is the same as the TwinPrimes estimate.
Is it a conjecture by Hardy and Littlewood that the two are asymptotically
the same?  In any case the result is roughly a factor 0.9 too small for the
small to medium size integers this module might calculate.  (See
L<Math::NumSeq::TwinPrimes>.)

=back

=head1 FORMULAS

=head2 Next

C<next()> is implemented by a C<Math::NumSeq::Primes> sequence filtered for
primes where 2P+1 is a prime too.  Dana Jacobsen noticed this is faster than
running a second Primes iterator for primes 2P+1.  This is since for a prime
P often 2P+1 has a small factor such as 3, 5 or 11.  A factor 3 occurs for
any P=6k+1 since in that case 2P+1 is a multiple of 3.  What else can be
said about the density or chance of a small factor?
