=head1 NAME

Math::NumSeq::Tribonacci -- Tribonacci numbers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::NumSeq::Tribonacci;
 my $seq = Math::NumSeq::Tribonacci->new;
 my ($i, $value) = $seq->next;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Tribonacci sequence 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, etc,

    T(i) = T(i-1) + T(i-2) + T(i-3)

starting from 0,0,1.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See L<Math::NumSeq/FUNCTIONS> for behaviour common to all sequence classes.

=over 4

=item C<$seq = Math::NumSeq::Tribonacci-E<gt>new ()>

Create and return a new sequence object.

=back

=head2 Random Access

=over

=item C<$value = $seq-E<gt>ith($i)>

Return the C<$i>'th Tribonacci number.

=item C<$bool = $seq-E<gt>pred($value)>

Return true if C<$value> is a Tribonacci number.

=item C<$i = $seq-E<gt>value_to_i_estimate($value)>

Return an estimate of the i corresponding to C<$value>.
