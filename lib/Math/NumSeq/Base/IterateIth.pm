=head1 NAME

Math::NumSeq::Base::IterateIth -- iterate by calling ith() successively

=for test_synopsis my @ISA

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 package MyNumSeqSubclass;
 use Math::NumSeq;
 use Math::NumSeq::Base::IterateIth;
 @ISA = ('Math::NumSeq::Base::IterateIth',
         'Math::NumSeq');
 sub ith {
   my ($self, $i) = @_;
   return something($i);
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a multi-inheritance mix-in providing the following methods

    rewind()
    next()
    seek_to_i()

They iterate simply by calling C<ith()> to get each successive value,
starting from C<i_start()>.

This is a handy way to implement the iterating methods for a C<NumSeq> if
there's nothing special that C<next()> can do beyond a full C<ith()>
calculation.

If C<ith()> returns C<undef> then that's taken to be the end of the sequence
and C<next()> returns no values.
