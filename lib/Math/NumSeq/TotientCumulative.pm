=head1 NAME

Math::NumSeq::TotientCumulative -- cumulative totients

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::NumSeq::TotientCumulative;
 my $seq = Math::NumSeq::TotientCumulative->new;
 my ($i, $value) = $seq->next;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The cumulative sum totient(1) to totient(i).

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See L<Math::NumSeq/FUNCTIONS> for behaviour common to all sequence classes.

=over 4

=item C<$seq = Math::NumSeq::TotientCumulative-E<gt>new ()>

Create and return a new sequence object.

=item C<$value = $seq-E<gt>ith($i)>

Return totient(i).

=item C<$bool = $seq-E<gt>pred($value)>

Return true if C<$value> occurs in the sequence, ie. is a sum totient(1) to
totient(i) for some i.
