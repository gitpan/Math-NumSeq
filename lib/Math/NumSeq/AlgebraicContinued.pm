Math::NumSeq::AlgebraicContinued -- continued fraction expansion of algebraic numbers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::NumSeq::AlgebraicContinued;
 my $seq = Math::NumSeq::AlgebraicContinued->new (expression => 'cbrt 2');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is terms in the continued fraction expansion of an algebraic number
such as a cube root or Nth root.  For example cbrt(2),

    1, 3, 1, 5, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 8, 1, 14, 1, 10, 2, 1, 4, 12, 2, ...
    starting i=0

A continued fraction approaches the root by a form

                 1   
    C = a[0] + -------------
               a[1] +   1
                      -------------
                      a[2] +   1
                             ----------
                             a[3] + ...

The first term a[0] is the integer part of C, leaving a remainder
S<0 E<lt> r E<lt> 1> which is expressed as r=1/R with S<R E<gt> 1>, so

               1   
   C = a[0] + ---
               R

Then a[1] is the integer part of that R, and so on repeatedly.

The current code uses a generic approach manipulating a polynomial with
C<Math::BigInt> coefficients (see L</FORMULAS> below).  It tends to be a
little slow because the coefficients become large, representing an ever more
precise approximation to the target value.

=head2 Expression

The C<expression> parameter currently only accepts a couple of forms for a
cube root or Nth root.

    cbrt 123
    7throot 123

The intention would be to perhaps take some simple fractions or products if
they can be turned into a polynomial easily.  Or take an initial polynomial
directly.

The continued fraction can be developed by maintaining a polynomial with
single real root equal to the remainder R at each stage.  (As per for
example Knuth volume 2 Seminumerical Algorithms section 4.5.3 exercise 13,
following Lagrange.)

As an example, a cube root cbrt(C) begins

    -x^3 + C = 0

and later has a set of coefficients p,q,r,s

    p*x^3 + q*x^2 + r*x + s = 0
    p,q,r,s integers and p < 0

From such an equation the integer part of the root can be found by looking
for the biggest integer x with

    p*x^3 + q*x^2 + r*x + s < 0

Choosing the signs so the high coefficient C<pE<lt>0> means the polynomial
is positive for small x and becomes negative above the root.

Various root finding algorithms could probably be used, but the current code
is a binary search.

The integer part is subtracted R-c and then inverted 1/(R-c) for the
continued fraction.  This is applied to the cubic equation first by a
substitution x+c,

    p*x^3 + (3pc+q)*x^2 + (3pc^2+2qc+r)x + (pc^3+qc^2+rc+s)

and then 1/x which is a reversal p,q,r,s -> s,r,q,p, and a term-wise
negation to keep S<pE<lt>0>.  So

    new p = -(p*c^3 + q*c^2 + r*c + s)
    new q = -(3p*c^2 + 2q*c + r)
    new r = -(3p*c + q)
    new s = -p

The values p,q,r,s are integers but may become large.  For a cube root they
seem to grow by about 1.7 bits per term.  Presumably growth is related to
the average size of the a[i] terms.

For a general polynomial the substitution x+c becomes a set of binomial
factors for the coefficients.

For a square root or other quadratic equation q*x^2+rx+s the continued
fraction terms repeat and can be calculated more efficiently than this
general approach (see L<Math::NumSeq::SqrtContinued>).

The binary search or similar root finding algorithm for the integer part is
important.  The integer part is often 1, and in that case a single check to
see if x=2 gives polyE<lt>0 suffices.  But a term can be quite large so a
linear search 1,2,3,4,etc is undesirable.  An example with large terms can
be found in Sloane's OEIS,

=over

L<http://oeis.org/A093876>
continued fraction of 4th root of 9.1, ie. (91/10)^(1/4)

=back

The first few terms include 75656 and 262344, before settling down to more
usual size terms it seems.
