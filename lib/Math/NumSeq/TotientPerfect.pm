=head1 NAME

Math::NumSeq::TotientPerfect -- sum of repeated totients is N itself

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::NumSeq::TotientPerfect;
 my $seq = Math::NumSeq::TotientPerfect->new;
 my ($i, $value) = $seq->next;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Numbers for which the sum of repeated totients until reaching 1 gives the
starting n itself.

    3, 9, 15, 27, 39, 81, 111, 183, 243, 255, ...

For example totient(15)=8, totient(8)=4, totient(4)=2 and totient(1)=1.
Adding them up 8+4+2+1=15 so 15 is a perfect totient.

The current implementation of C<next()> is merely a search by C<pred()>
through all odd integers, which isn't very fast.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See L<Math::NumSeq/FUNCTIONS> for behaviour common to all sequence classes.

=over 4

=item C<$seq = Math::NumSeq::TotientPerfect-E<gt>new ()>

Create and return a new sequence object.

=item C<$bool = $seq-E<gt>pred($value)>

Return true if C<$value> is a perfect totient.
