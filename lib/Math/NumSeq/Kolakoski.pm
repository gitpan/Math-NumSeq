=head1 NAME

Math::NumSeq::Kolakoski -- sequence of 1s and 2s its own run lengths

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::NumSeq::Kolakoski;
 my $seq = Math::NumSeq::Kolakoski->new;
 my ($i, $value) = $seq->next;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A sequence 1,2,2,1,1,2,1,etc, each run length being given successively by
the sequence itself.

Starting from 1,2, at i=2 the values is 2, so there should be a run of two
2s.  Then at i=3 value 2 means two 1s.  Then at i=4 value 1 means a run of
one 2.  The value alternates between 1 and 2 and the sequence values
themselves determine the run length to give that value, either 1 or 2.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See L<Math::NumSeq/FUNCTIONS> for behaviour common to all sequence classes.

=over 4

=item C<$seq = Math::NumSeq::Kolakoski-E<gt>new ()>

Create and return a new sequence object.

=back

=head1 FORMULAS

There's no need to keep the entire sequence, nor even the portion between
where i is up to and the values past that which those up to i induce.
Instead the value at i is determined by the earlier value, which is
determined a yet earlier value, etc.  At each level only a value and pending
count need to be kept.  The levels required end up being about log base 1.6
of the position i.
