=head1 NAME

Math::NumSeq::SqrtContinuedPeriod -- period of the continued fraction for sqrt(i)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::NumSeq::SqrtContinuedPeriod;
 my $seq = Math::NumSeq::SqrtContinuedPeriod->new;
 my ($i, $value) = $seq->next;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This the period of the repeating part of the continued fraction expansion of
sqrt(i).

    0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 4, 2, etc

For example sqrt(12) is 3 then terms 2,6 repeating, which is period 2.

                    1   
   sqrt(12) = 3 + ----------- 
                  2 +   1
                      -----------
                      6 +   1
                          ----------
                          2 +   1
                              ---------
                              6 + ...        2,6 repeating

All square root continued fractions like this comprise an integer part
followed by repeating terms of some length.  Perfect squares are an integer
part only, nothing further, and the period for them is taken to be 0.

The continued fraction calculation has denominator value at each stage of
the form

   den =(P+sqrt(S)) / Q

   with

   0 <= P <= root
   0 < Q <= 2*root+1
   where root=floor(sqrt(S))

The limited range of P,Q means a finite set of combinations at most
root*(2*root+1), which is roughly 2*S.  In practice it's much less.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See L<Math::NumSeq/FUNCTIONS> for behaviour common to all sequence classes.

=over 4

=item C<$seq = Math::NumSeq::SqrtContinuedPeriod-E<gt>new (sqrt =E<gt> $s)>

Create and return a new sequence object giving the Continued expansion terms of
C<sqrt($s)>.

=item C<$value = $seq-E<gt>ith ($i)>

Return the period of sqrt($i).
