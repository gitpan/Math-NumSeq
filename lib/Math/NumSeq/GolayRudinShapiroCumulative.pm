=head1 NAME

Math::NumSeq::GolayRudinShapiroCumulative -- cumulative Golay/RudinShapiro sequence

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::NumSeq::GolayRudinShapiroCumulative;
 my $seq = Math::NumSeq::GolayRudinShapiroCumulative->new;
 my ($i, $value) = $seq->next;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the Golay/Rudin/Shapiro sequence values accumulated as
GRS(0)+...+GRS(i),

    starting from i=0 value=GRS(0)

    1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 6, 5, 4, 5, 4, ...

The total is always positive, and in fact a given cumulative total k occurs
precisely k times.  For example the three occurrences of 3 shown above are
all the places 3 occurs.

This GRS cumulative arises as in the alternate paper folding curve as the
coordinate sum X+Y.  The way k occurs k many times has a geometric
interpretation as the points on the diagonal X+Y=k of the curve visited a
total of k many times.  See L<Math::PlanePath::AlternatePaper/dSum>.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See L<Math::NumSeq/FUNCTIONS> for behaviour common to all sequence classes.

=over 4

=item C<$seq = Math::NumSeq::GolayRudinShapiroCumulative-E<gt>new ()>

Create and return a new sequence object.

=back

=head2 Random Access

=over

=item C<$value = $seq-E<gt>ith($i)>

Return the C<$i>'th value from the sequence, being the total
C<GRS(0)+GRS(1)+...+GRS($i)>.

=item C<$bool = $seq-E<gt>pred($value)>

Return true if C<$value> occurs in the sequence.  All positive integers
occur, so this simply means integer C<$value E<gt>= 1>.

=head1 FORMULAS

=head2 Ith

The cumulative total GRS(0)+...+GRS(i-1) can be calculated from the 1-bits
of i.  Each 1-bit becomes a value 2^floor((pos+1)/2) in the total,

    bit    value
    ---    -----
     0       1
     1       2
     2       2
     3       4
     4       4
    ...     ...
     k      2^ceil(k/2)

The value is added or subtracted from the total according to the number of
11 bit pairs above that bit position, not including the bit itself,

    add value    if even count of adjacent 11 bit pairs above
    sub value    if odd count

For example i=27 is 110011 in binary so

    1      -1      bit0 low bit
    1      -2      bit1
    0              bit2
    1      +4      bit3
    1      +4      bit4 high bit
          ----
            5      cumulative value GRS(0)+...+GRS(26)

The second lowest bit is negated as value -2 because there's one "11" bit
pair above it, and -1 the same because above and not including that bit
there's just one "11" bit pair.

Or for example i=31 is 11111 in binary so

    1      -1      bit0 low bit
    1      +2      bit1 
    1      -2      bit2 
    1      +4      bit3 
    1      +4      bit4 high bit
          ----
            7      cumulative total GRS(0)+...+GRS(30)

Here at bit2 the value is -2 because there's one adjacent 11 above, not
including bit2 itself.  Then at bit1 there's two 11 pairs above so +2, and
at bit0 there's three so -1.

The total can be formed by examining the bits high to low and counting
adjacent 11 bits on the way down to add or subtract.  Or it can be formed
from low to high by negating the total so far when a 11 pair is encountered.

For an inclusive sum GRS(0)+...+GRS(i) as per this module, the extra GRS(i)
can be worked into the calculation by its GRS definition +1 or -1 according
to the total number of adjacent 11 bits.  This can be thought of as an extra
value 1 below the least significant bit.  For example i=27 inclusive

           +1      below all bits
    1      -1      bit0 low bit
    1      -2      bit1
    0              bit2
    1      +4      bit3
    1      +4      bit4 high bit
          ----
            5      cumulative value GRS(0)+...+GRS(27)

For low to high calculation this lowest +/-1 can be handled simply by
starting the total at 1.  It then becomes +1 or -1 by the negations as 11s
are encountered for the rest of the bit handling.

    total = 1   # initial value below all bits to be inclusive GRS(i)
    power = 1   # 2^ceil(bitpos/2)
    thisbit = take bit from low end of i

    loop
      nextbit = take bit from low end of i
      if thisbit&&nextbit
        then total = -total    # negate lower values added
      if thisbit
        then total += power
      thisbit = nextbit

      power *= 2
      exit loop if i==0

      nextbit = bit from low end of i
      if thisbit&&nextbit
        then total = -total    # negate lower values added
      if thisbit
        then total += power
      thisbit = nextbit
      exit loop if i==0
    endloop

    total += power     # final for highest 1-bit in i
    # total=GRS(0)+...+GRS(i)

This sort of calculation arises implicitly in the alternate paper folding
curve to calculate X,Y for a given N point on the curve.  But that
calculation does a simultaneous using the base 4 digits of N.

    X=GRStotal(ceil(N/2))
    Y=GRStotal(floor(N/2))
