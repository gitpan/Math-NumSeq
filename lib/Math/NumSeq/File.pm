=head1 NAME

Math::NumSeq::File -- sequence read from a file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::NumSeq::File;
 my $seq = Math::NumSeq::File->new (filename => 'foo.txt');
 my ($i, $value) = $seq->next;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A sequence of values read from a file.  This is designed to read a file of
numbers in NumSeq style.

The intention is to be flexible about the file format and to auto-detect as
far as possible.  Currently the only format is plain text, either a single
value per line, or a pair i and value.

    123                   # value per line
    456

    1  123                # i and value per line
    2  456

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See L<Math::NumSeq/FUNCTIONS> for behaviour common to all sequence classes.

=over 4

=item C<$seq = Math::NumSeq::File-E<gt>new (filename =E<gt> $filename)>

Create and return a new sequence object to read C<$filename>.
