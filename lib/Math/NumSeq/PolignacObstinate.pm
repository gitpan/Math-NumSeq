=head1 NAME

Math::NumSeq::PolignacObstinate -- odd integers not prime+2^k

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::NumSeq::PolignacObstinate;
 my $seq = Math::NumSeq::PolignacObstinate->new;
 my ($i, $value) = $seq->next;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This sequence is integers which cannot be represented as prime+2^k for an
integer k.  These are counter-examples to a conjecture by Prince de Polignac
that every odd integer occurs as prime+2^k (and are called "obstinate"
numbers by Andy Edwards).

    1, 127, 149, 251, 331, 337, ...

For example 149 is obstinate because it cannot be written as prime+2^k.
Working backwards, it can be seen that none of 149-1, 149-2, 149-4, 149-8,
... 149-128 are primes.

A theorem by Erdos gives infinitely many such obstinate integers (in an
arithmetic progression).

The value 3 is not in the sequence because it can be written prime+2^k, for
prime=2 and k=0.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See L<Math::NumSeq/FUNCTIONS> for behaviour common to all sequence classes.

=over 4

=item C<$seq = Math::NumSeq::PolignacObstinate-E<gt>new ()>

Create and return a new sequence object.

=item C<$bool = $seq-E<gt>pred($value)>

Return true if C<$value> is obstinate, ie. that there's no C<$k E<gt>= 0>
for which C<$value - 2**$k> is a prime.

This check requires prime testing up to C<$value> and in the current code a
hard limit of 2**32 is placed on the C<$value> to be checked, in the
interests of not going into a near-infinite loop.
