=head1 NAME

Math::NumSeq::SternDiatomic -- Stern's diatomic sequence

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::NumSeq::SternDiatomic;
 my $seq = Math::NumSeq::SternDiatomic->new;
 my ($i, $value) = $seq->next;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is Moritz Stern's diatomic sequence

    0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, ...
    starting i=0

It's constructed by successive levels with a recurrence

    D(0)     = 0
    D(1)     = 1
    D(2*i)   = D(i)
    D(2*i+1) = D(i) + D(i+1)

So the sequence is extended by copying the previous level to the next spead
out to even indices, and at the odd indices fill in the sum of adjacent
terms,

    0,                    i=0
    1,                    i=1
    1,      2,            i=2 to 3
    1,  3,  2,  3,        i=4 to 7
    1,4,3,5,2,5,3,4,      i=8 to 15

For example the i=4to7 row is a copy of the preceding row values 1,2 with
sums 1+2 and 2+1 interleaved.

For the new value at the end of each row the sum wraps around so as to take
the last copied value and the first value of the next row, which is
always 1.  This means the last value in each row increments 1,2,3,4,5,etc.

=head2 Odd and Even

The sequence makes a repeating pattern even,odd,odd,

    0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3
    E  O  O  E  O  O  E ...

This can be seen from the copying in the recurrence above.  For example the
i=8 to 15 row copying to i=16 to 31,

    O . E . O . O . E . O . O . E .      spread
      O   O   E   O   O   E   O   O      sum adjacent

Adding adjacent terms odd+even and even+odd are both odd.  Adding adjacent
odd+odd gives even.  So the pattern E,O,O in the original row when spread
and added gives E,O,O again in the next row.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See L<Math::NumSeq/FUNCTIONS> for behaviour common to all sequence classes.

=over 4

=item C<$seq = Math::NumSeq::SternDiatomic-E<gt>new ()>

Create and return a new sequence object.

=back

=head2 Random Access

=over

=item C<$value = $seq-E<gt>ith($i)>

Return the C<$i>'th value of the sequence.

=item C<($v0, $v1) = $seq-E<gt>ith_pair($i)>

Return two values C<ith($i)> and C<ith($i+1)> from the sequence.  As
described below (L</Ith Pair>) two values can be calculated with the same
work as one.

=item C<$bool = $seq-E<gt>pred($value)>

Return true if C<$value> occurs in the sequence, which means simply integer
C<$valueE<gt>=0>.

=back

=head1 FORMULAS

=head2 Next

X<Newman, Moshe>The sequence is iterated using a method by Moshe Newman in

=over

"Recounting the Rationals, Continued", answers to problem 10906 posed by
Donald E. Knuth, C. P. Rupert, Alex Smith and Richard Stong, American
Mathematical Monthly, volume 110, number 7, Aug-Sep 2003, pages 642-643,
L<http://www.jstor.org/stable/3647762>

=back

Two successive sequence values are maintained and are advanced by a simple
operation.

    p = seq[i]    q = seq[i+1]  
    initially p=seq[0]=0 and q=seq[1]=1

    p_next = seq[i+1] = q
    q_next = seq[i+2] = p+q - 2*(p mod q)

    where the mod operation rounds towards zero
    0 <= (p mod q) <= q-1

The form by Newman uses a floor operation.  This suits expressing the
iteration in terms of a rational x[i]=p/q.

    p_next              1
    ------  =  ----------------------
    q_next     1 + 2*floor(p/q) - p/q

For separate p,q a little rearrangement gives it in terms of the remainder p
mod q.

    division p = q*floor(p/q) + rem      where rem = (p mod q)
    then
    p_next/q_next = 1 / (1 + 2*floor(p/q) - p/q)    per Newman
                  = q / (2*q*floor(p/q) + q - p)
                  = q / (2*(p - rem) + q - p)  
                  = q / (p+q - 2*rem)               using p,q

C<seek_to_i()> is implemented by calculating new p,q values with an Ith Pair
per below.

=cut

# f*q + r = p
# f*q = p - r
# q-r = 1 - (-p % q)
# next = 1 / (2*floor(p/q) + 1 - p/q)
#      = q / (2*q*floor(p/q) + q - p)
#      = q / (2*q*f + q - p)
#      = q / (2*(p - r) + q - p)
#      = q / (2*p - 2*r + q - p)
#      = q / (p + q - 2*r)

=head2 Ith Pair

The two sequence values at an arbitrary i,i+1 can be calculated from the
bits of i,

    p = 0
    q = 1
    for each bit of i from high to low
      if bit=1 then p += q
      if bit=0 then q += p
    return p,q      # are ith(i) and ith(i+1)

For example i=6 is binary "110" so

                         p,q
                         ---
   initial               0,1 
   high bit=1 so p+=q    1,1   
   next bit=1 so p+=q    2,1    
   low  bit=0 so q+=p    2,3   is ith(6),ith(7)

This is the same as the Calkin-Wilf tree descent, per
L<Math::PlanePath::RationalsTree/Calkin-Wilf Tree>.  Its X/Y fractions are
successive Stern diatomic sequence values.

=head2 Ith Alone

If only a single ith() value is desired then the bits of i can be taken from
low to high with the same loop as above.  In that case p=ith(i) but q is not
ith(i+1).  Any low zero bits can be ignored for this method since initial
p=0 means their steps q+=p do nothing.
